        <p>The following questions were asked to three self-checkout users:</p>
        <ol class="bullets">
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Why did you decide to use the self-checkout station rather than go
            to the cashier?
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Does the self-checkout station make your shopping experience more
            efficient? Why or why not?

          <li class="bullet-item">
            Were you able to easily scan the barcodes and select a payment

            Did you have any difficulties using the touchscreen?

        <h1>Key Observations</h1>
        <p>
          Three people were observed using the self-checkout machine. Below is a
          summary of observations of their actions.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Some users needed to try multiple times to input a number or
            backspace because of an incorrect input.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Some users use the bottom barcode scanner by moving the item
            straight across with the barcode facing down whereas other users
            face the barcode towards the machine.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Most users used a contactless payment method by tapping their card
            or phone to the payment system screen.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Sometimes the scale did not recognize when a scanned item was placed
            upon it, so users had to lift the item and place it back on the
            scale.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            A staff member is needed to delete an item in case it is scanned
            multiple times by mistake.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="responses">Responses</h1>
        <p>
          The responses to the
          <a href="index.html">interview questions</a> are summarized below:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Most users knew exactly what to do when using the machine. The big
            buttons indicating the next task made the steps clear.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            The touchscreen provided some difficulties for multiple users. It
            was sometimes unresponsive or would recognize the incorrect input.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            The machine is not optimal for cash customers. One user noted that
            needing to smooth out the bill before feeding it to the machine is a
            major inconvenience.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet-item">
            Some users use the machine not for efficiency’s sake, but to avoid
            human interaction. Other users reported using the machine because
            the line for the cashier was too long.
          </li>
        </ul>
